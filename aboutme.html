        <p>Hi, my name is Bridget Kiernicki and I’m currently pursuing a B.S. in Biology as well as a minor in English at Temple University. I’m set to graduate in December 2019 and hope to further my education with a master’s degree. When I’m not in class or studying, you can usually find me outside immersed in nature or caring for my animals. As someone who’s been passionate about wildlife her entire life, I see it only fitting that I try to pursue my dream of entering the field of wildlife biology because there’s no better way I can think of to give back to the animals and ecosystems I love than to dedicate my life to their conservation.</p>
