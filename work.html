            <p>The following research piece was submitted as an individual project for a Primate Behavior course taken at the Temple University. The subjects were gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) of varying ages and sexes which were located at the Philadelphia zoo. The gorillasâ€™ actions were observed and marked down in real time in order to make larger generalizations about their behavior. The paper contains an ethogram (which a catalog of behavior) and an ad libitum (which lists and defines all possible behaviors). My role was to observe, note, and analyze the data.</p>

            <p>This file contains a powerpoint summary of a scienitfic article entitled "Kinship, parental manipulation and the evoutionary origin of eusociality" (Kapheim et al 2015). The subject in this article is the tropical sweat bee, Megalopta genalis. It was submitted as a group project for an Animal Behavior course taken at the Temple University. My role, similar to that of my other groupmates, was to read the report, analyize the data, and draw conclusions from the information given.</p>

            <p>Dementia Care is a simulation website created for use by dementia patients and their families. It was an individual project for a Texts and Cultures of Science course taken at Temple University. The intention was to extract information from sites used by medical professionals and translate it into an empathetic  language intended for a broader audience (in particular the patients and family of the patients) without compromising the effectiveness and accuracy of the content. </p>
